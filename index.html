        <p>Hi, my name is Jaren. My wife and I and our three kids live in Victorville, california. I have fun hiking and using a telescope to
            watch the planets. I also like to do research in nutrition and work with electronics as a hobby. I grow some
            of my own food. I have taken some classes in C++. I am in school to learn more about computer programming and to learn how to do family history research.
            Occasionally I write poetry. I lived through the Northridge earthquake and was touched by Mount Saint
            Helens. I hope everyone is doing well.</p>
